# How to Play

**Set Your Bet:** Before you can roll the dice, you need to set your bet. Use the slider at the bottom of the screen to choose how much you want to bet. The slider allows for fine control over your bet, so you can decide on the strategy that works best for you.

**Roll the Dice:** Once your bet is set, hit the 'Roll' button to roll the dice. The fate of your bet depends on the sum of the numbers that come up. Watch as the dice roll and come to a stop, revealing their numbers.

**Scoring:**
Perfect Match: If the sum of the numbers rolled exactly matches your bet, you're in luck! You'll receive 100 points for your precise prediction.
Close Call: If the sum of the rolled numbers is within two units of your bet (either above or below), you'll still earn points for being close. A sum within this range grants you 50 points, rewarding your near-perfect guess.
